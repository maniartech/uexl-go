# Functions

Functions in UExL allow you to perform operations, calculations, and data transformations. Built-in functions cover common needs, and user-defined functions can extend the language.

## Calling Functions
Functions are called by name, followed by parentheses containing arguments:
```
min(1, 2, 3)
concat("hello", " ", "world")
len([1, 2, 3])
```

Arguments can be any valid expression.
