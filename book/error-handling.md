# Error Handling

UExL provides structured error handling to help you identify and debug issues in your expressions.

## Error Object Structure
When an error occurs, UExL returns an error object with the following fields:
- `errorCode`: A string identifying the error type (e.g., `SyntaxError`, `TypeError`).
- `message`: A human-readable description of the error.
- `line`: The line number where the error occurred (if available).
- `column`: The column number where the error occurred (if available).

### Example Error Object
```
{
  errorCode: "SyntaxError",
  message: "Unexpected token '}'",
  line: 2,
  column: 10
}
```

## Common Error Types
- `SyntaxError`: Invalid syntax in the expression.
- `TypeError`: Operation on incompatible types (e.g., adding a string and an object).
- `ReferenceError`: Accessing an undefined variable or property.
- `ArgumentError`: Wrong number or type of arguments to a function.
- `EvaluationError`: General evaluation failure.

## Debugging Tips
- Enable debug mode to get detailed error messages and stack traces (if supported by the host environment).
- Check line and column numbers to locate the error in your expression.
- Use parentheses to clarify complex expressions and avoid precedence issues.
- Test sub-expressions separately to isolate the problem.

## Practical Examples
```
// Syntax error
{a: 1,, b: 2}
// => errorCode: "SyntaxError"

// Type error
"abc" * 2
// => errorCode: "TypeError"

// Reference error
x + 1
// => errorCode: "ReferenceError" (if x is not defined)

// Argument error
min()
// => errorCode: "ArgumentError"
```

## Edge Cases
- Some errors may return `null` instead of an error object, depending on context.
- Errors inside pipes or functions may propagate or be caught, depending on implementation.
