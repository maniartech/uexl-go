# Context

Understanding context is essential for writing powerful and correct UExL expressions. In this chapter, you'll learn what context means in UExL, how variables are resolved, and how data flows through your expressionsâ€”with practical examples along the way.

## What Is Context?
Context refers to the set of variables and values available during expression evaluation. It determines how identifiers are resolved and how data is passed through pipes and functions.

## Variable Scope
- Variables are resolved from the current context, which may include global, local, or function-specific variables.
- In pipe expressions, `$1`, `$2`, etc. refer to values passed between stages. `$1` is the output of the previous stage; for reduce pipes, `$2` is the accumulator or second argument.
- Functions and pipes may introduce their own local context for arguments, shadowing variables from outer scopes.

## Context Propagation
- When evaluating nested expressions, the current context is passed down, allowing inner expressions to access variables defined in outer scopes.
- Assignments (if supported) update the current context.
- Context can be extended or overridden in function calls and pipe stages.

## Practical Examples
```
user = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
user.name // Resolves to "Alice"

[1, 2, 3] |map: $1 * 2 // $1 is each element in the array

users = [{"name": "Bob", "active": true}, {"name": "Eve", "active": false}]
users |filter: $1.active |map: $1.name // Filters active users and extracts names
```

## Edge Cases and Tips
- Referencing an undefined variable returns `null`.
- Shadowing: Inner scopes can define variables with the same name as outer scopes, hiding the outer value.
- Use descriptive variable names to avoid confusion.

## Practice: Try It Yourself
Try these context-based expressions:
```
settings = {"theme": "dark", "lang": "en"}
settings.theme

[10, 20, 30] |map: $1 + 5
users |filter: $1.role == "admin" |map: $1.email
```

Understanding context will help you write robust and maintainable UExL code. In the next chapter, we'll explore error handling and debugging strategies.
