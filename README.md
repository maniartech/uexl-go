# UExL (Universal Expression Language) in Golang

## Introduction

UExL (Universal Expression Language) is an embeddable platform independent
expression evaluation engine. It is a simple language that can be used to
evaluate expressions in various formats. UExL is designed to be used in
applications where the expression to be evaluated is not known at compile time.
Or to make the application more flexible by allowing the user to define
expressions through the configuration file or database.

, is a . Designed for efficiency and simplicity, UExL offers an intuitive approach to handling and evaluating expressions in various formats.

## Installation

UExL is *not yet released and ready* for use. However, whenever it is, you can
install it using the following instructions.

### Installing UExL

To install UExL, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
go get github.com/maniartech/uexl-go
```

This command downloads and installs the UExL package along with its dependencies.

## Getting Started

### Importing the Library

First, include UExL in your Go project by importing it:

```go
import "github.com/maniartech/uexl-go"
```

### Basic Usage

Hereâ€™s how you can quickly start using UExL to evaluate an expression:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/maniartech/uexl-go"
    "log"
)

func main() {
    // Evaluating a simple expression
    result, err := uexl.Eval("10 + 20")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    fmt.Printf("Result: %v\n", result) // Output: Result: 30

    // Using pipe operator in expression
    result, err = uexl.Eval("10 + 20 |: $1 * 2")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    fmt.Printf("Result: %v\n", result) // Output: Result: 60
}
```

This basic example demonstrates how to use UExL to evaluate simple arithmetic expressions.

## Operator Precedence

| Operators | Type             | Associativity   |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------|
| `(` `)`   | Parentheses      | Left to Right   |
| `.`       | Dot              | Left to Right   |
| `%`       | Modulus          | Left to Right   |
| `*` `/`   | Multiplicative   | Left to Right   |
| `+` `-`   | Additive         | Left to Right   |
| `<<` `>>` | Bitwise Shift    | Left to Right   |
| `<` `>` `<=` `>=` | Comparison | Left to Right |
| `==` `!=` | Equality         | Left to Right   |
| `&` `\|` `^` | Bitwise       | Left to Right   |
| `&&` `\|\|` | Logical        | Left to Right   |
| `\|:`     | Pipe             | Left to Right   |

## Examples

```go
result, err := uexl.Eval("10 + 20 |: $1 * 2") // Returns 60

if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

exprc, err := uexl.Compile("10 + 20 |: abc * 2")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

result, err := uexl.Run(exprc, map[]{
  "abc": 30,
})

fmt.Println("Result:", result)
```
