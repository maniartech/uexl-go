# Variables and Identifiers

Variables and identifiers in UExL can contain letters, numbers, underscores, and the dollar sign. Identifiers cannot start with a number.

## Examples
```
x
count
user_name
$value
```

Dot notation is used to access object properties:
```
user.name
data.values[0]
```

Within pipe operations, `$1` refers to the input value passed to the pipe.
