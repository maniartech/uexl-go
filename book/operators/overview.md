# Operators

UExL provides a variety of operators for arithmetic, logical, bitwise, comparison, and pipe operations. Operators are organized by type and precedence.

## Categories
- Primary (grouping, property/index access)
- Unary (negation, logical NOT)
- Arithmetic (+, -, *, /, %)
- Bitwise (&, |, ^, <<, >>)
- Comparison (<, >, <=, >=)
- Equality (==, !=)
- Logical (&&, ||)
- Pipe (|:, |map:, |filter:, |reduce:)

See the next section for operator precedence and details.
